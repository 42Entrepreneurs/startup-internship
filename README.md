# Start-up School by 42 Entrepreneurs

### What is it?
Start-up school is a program designed by 42E to help you launching your start-up project. We will create a little batch of very motivated people, we eill meet weekly and organise talks and support amongs us for 3 months! We will have talks about tech (pragmatism in code, git understanding, etc), business (POC, bootstraping, market-fit, etc) and more.

### Who is this for ?
People who want to write their own adventure. We are looking for motivated students who want to take their independence and start a startup. If you are still not sure about starting a startup you may want to read [**A student's guide to startup**](http://www.paulgraham.com/mit.html) or [**Why to not not start a startup**](http://www.paulgraham.com/notnot.html) from P. Graham.

### How long ?
The program is designed for a 3 month duration, but 42E will accompany you as long as you may need it!

### Content
The content will be designed with the first sessions of startup school. We will have regular mandatory & optionnal workshop on tech / legal / business / design.
We will meet a least once a week to talk about your objectives and strategy.
There will be also office-hours (at least once per month) with experienced staff of 42E.
At the end of the batch we would like to organise a "demo-day" where each startup will pitch their project to our partners.
We will have weekly standups to talk about the problems we face to face it together.
There will be mandatory talks presented by __you__ as a startup founder on subject of your choice for the startup school batch.
